                        " MUSIC " <br><br>       
                        Art and music are basic human functions. The interaction with sound is unavoidable, either to make it or take pleasure in it. <br>When we talk about music we are talking about all the instruments like drums, piano, guitar, veena, sitar, etc.,
                        <br> Lyrics, composition, and the emotions in
                        it and how all these get along to make a song that is all pleasing to our ears.<br> We all have some favourite songs which we love to sing and dance. 
                        <br>Wouldn't life be little boring without music?<br> It is something that we all need to enjoy our days 
                        slightly more than we already do <br>because music adds more colours and emotions to our lives and it can also stimulate the mind. 
                    </p>

                    <p>So here the question arises "How does it work?" and "What interesting  functions it has??"</p>
                    
                    <p> Well!! In this fast moving world the users look for more attractive themes and interesting functions so there are two amazing themes in this page<br> i.e dark and 
                        lite mode which brings bold look to our page as well as to the music...<br>
                        And the interesting function in this is we can play the music with a single click <br>isn't it amazing that all major functions
                        ( play, pause and stop) just done with a single click.
                    </p>

                        E A Bucchianeri quotes "Ah the magic of music, with it, all things are possible"...<br>
                        Indeed music is the strongest form of magic and easiest way to 
                        express one's emotion...<br> With a hope to create some magic we have built a small website 
                        which helps in playing music.<br> Hope you all enjoy listening to music as we do. 
                        Happy listening and keep dancing to the lyrics!!
